[^aoc]:
[Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015. Every year
since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
